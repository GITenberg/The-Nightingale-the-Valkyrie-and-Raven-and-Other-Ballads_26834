5</span>THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL</h2>
<p>I know where stands a Castellaye,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Its turrets are so fairly gilt;<br />
With silver are its gates inlaid,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Its walls of marble stone are built.</p>
<p>Within it stands a linden tree,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With lovely leaves its boughs are hung,<br />
Therein doth dwell a nightingale,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And sweetly moves that bird its tongue.</p>
<p>A gallant knight came riding by,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He heard its dulcet ditty ring;<br />
And sorely, sorely, wondered he<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At midnight hour that it should sing.</p>
<p><!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>&ldquo;And hear, thou little Nightingale,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If thou to me wilt sing a lay,<br />
Thy feathers I&rsquo;ll with gold bedeck,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy neck with costly pearls array.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With golden feathers others lure,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Such gifts for me have value slight;<br />
I am a strange and lonely bird,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But little known to mortal wight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And thou, a strange wild bird thou be,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whom other mortals little know;<br />
Yet hunger pinches thee, and cold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When falls the cruel winter snow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I laugh at hunger, laugh at snow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which falls so wide on hill and lea;<br />
But I am vexed by secret care,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I know not either joy or glee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Betwixt the hills and valleys deep<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Away the rapid rivers flow;<br />
But ah! remembrance of true love<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From out the mind will never go.</p>
<p><!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>&ldquo;O I had once a handsome love,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A famous knight of valour he;<br />
But ah! my step-dame all o&rsquo;erturn&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She vowed our marriage ne&rsquo;er should be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She changed me to a Nightingale,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bade me around the world to fly;<br />
My Brother she changed to a wolf so gray,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bade him into the forest hie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She told him, as the wood he sought,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That he should win his shape no more,<br />
&rsquo;Till he had drunk her heart&rsquo;s blood out,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And that befell when years were o&rsquo;er.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It happened on a summer tide,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Amidst the wood she wandered gay,<br />
My brother saw and watched her close,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From &rsquo;neath the bushes where he lay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He seized her quickly by the foot,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All with his laidly wolfish claw;<br />
Tore out her heart, and drank her blood,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And thus released himself he saw.</p>
<p><!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>&ldquo;Yet I am still a little bird,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And o&rsquo;er the verdant meads I fly;<br />
So sorrowful I pass my life,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But mostly &rsquo;neath the winter&rsquo;s sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But God be thanked, he me has waked,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And speech from him my tongue has won;<br />
For fifteen years I have not spoke<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As I with thee, Sir Knight, have done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But ever with a mournful voice,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Have sung the green wood bough upon;<br />
And had no better dwelling place<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Than gloomy forests, sad and lone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now hear, thou little Nightingale,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; This simple thing would I propose,<br />
In winter sit within my bower,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And hie thee forth when summer blows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O many thanks, thou handsome knight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy offer would I accept full fane;<br />
But ah, my step-dame that forbade<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whilst still in feather I remain.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>The Nightingale sat musing deep,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Unto the knight she paid no heed,<br />
Until he seized her by the foot,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For God I ween had so decreed.</p>
<p>He carried her to his chamber in,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The doors and windows fast he made;<br />
Then changed she to the strangest beasts<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That ever mortal eye survey&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>A lion now, and now a bear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And now a coil of hissing snakes;<br />
At last a Dragon she became,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And furious she the knight attacks.</p>
<p>He cut her with a little knife,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So that her blood did stain the floor;<br />
Then straight before his eye there stood<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A Damsel bright as any flower.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Damsel fair, I&rsquo;ve rescued thee<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From thraldom drear and secret care;<br />
Now tell me of thy ancestry,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy parents and thy race declare.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>&ldquo;My father he was England&rsquo;s King,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My mother was his lovely Queen;<br />
My brother once a grey wolf was,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And trotted o&rsquo;er the wold so green.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If England&rsquo;s King thy father was,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And thy dear mother England&rsquo;s Queen,<br />
Thou art my sister&rsquo;s daughter then,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who long a Nightingale has been.&rdquo;</p>
<p>O there was joy throughout the land,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And all the court was filled with glee;<br />
The Knight has caught the Nightingale,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That dwelt within the linden tree.</p>

11</span>THE VALKYRIE AND RAVEN</h2>
<p>Ye men wearing bracelets<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Be mute whilst I sing<br />
Of Harald the hero&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; High Norroway&rsquo;s king;<br />
I&rsquo;ll duly declare<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A discourse which I heard,<br />
Betwixt a bright maiden<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And black raven bird.</p>
<p>The Valkyrie&rsquo;s vext<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No war-field to find;<br />
The speech she knew well<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the wild feather&rsquo;d kind,<br />
And thus she bespake him<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who bears the brown bill,<br />
So proud as he perch&rsquo;d on<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The peak of the hill.</p>
<p><!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>&ldquo;What do you here, ravens,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And whence come ye, say,<br />
Your heads turn&rsquo;d direct to<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The dying sun&rsquo;s ray?<br />
Bits of flesh hold your claws&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; There&rsquo;s blood flowing free<br />
From your beaks, surely nigh<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dead bodies there be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then wiping his beak,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bloody red, on the rock,<br />
The eagle&rsquo;s sworn brother<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus answer&rsquo;d and spoke:<br />
&ldquo;Harald we&rsquo;ve follow&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Halfdan the son,<br />
Ever since from the egg<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That we egress have won.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then ye know, bird, the king,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose keep is in Kvine,<br />
The young king&mdash;the Norse king&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose keels cut the brine;<br />
<!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

&nbsp;&nbsp; Betarr&rsquo;d are his oars&mdash;<br />
His sails are all bleach&rsquo;d<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With the sea-spray and showers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Abroad will drink Yule,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The young king, and will try<br />
To wake up, O maiden,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The wild game of Frey,<br />
Of the warmth of the hearth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He weary is grown;<br />
He loathes the close chamber<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And cushions of down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heard ye not the hard fight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Near Hafirsfirth beach,<br />
&rsquo;Twixt the king of high kindred<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And Kotva the rich?<br />
Sail&rsquo;d ships from the East<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Prepared for war stern;<br />
Their dragon heads gaped,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their gilded sides burn.</p>

Grimly the Baresarkers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Grinn&rsquo;d, biting steel,&mdash;<br />
Howl&rsquo;d the wolf-heathens<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; War madness they feel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They moved &rsquo;gainst the monarch<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose might makes them pine,<br />
&rsquo;Gainst the king&mdash;the Norse king&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who keeps court at Utstein;<br />
Flinch&rsquo;d the king&rsquo;s bark at first,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For they ply&rsquo;d her right well&mdash;<br />
There was hammering on helmets<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ere Haklangr fell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Left the land to the lad<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With the locks long and full,<br />
Rich Kotva, the lord,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thick of neck, like the bull;<br />

15</span>&rsquo;Neath the thwarts themselves threw,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They who&rsquo;d wounds, in despair,<br />
Their heads to the keel<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And their heels to the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On their shoulders their shields,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Such as Swafni&rsquo;s roof form,<br />
Flinging swift as a fence<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From the fierce stony storm;<br />
The yeomen affrighted<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From Hafirsfirth speed,<br />
And arrived at their homes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They call hoarsely for mead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The slain strew the strand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the very great joy<br />
Of ourselves and of Odin,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The chief of one eye.&rdquo;</p>

21</span>ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG</h2>
<p>Early at morn the lark sang gay&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>All underneath so green a hill</i>)<br />
Sir Carl by his bed put on his array&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>The Danish King will &rsquo;venge his
fill</i>).</p>
<p>He drew on his shirt as white as milk,<br />
Then his doublet foisted with verdant silk.</p>
<p>His legs in his buckskin boots he placed,<br />
And around them his gilded spurs he braced.</p>
<p>His gilded spurs there around he braced,<br />
And away to the Ting he rode in haste.</p>
<p>Sir Carl he galloped along the way,<br />
Such wondrous things he proved that day.</p>
<p><!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>Sir Carl he galloped up to the Ting,<br />
The crowd before him scattering.</p>
<p>To warriors nine the Dane-king cries:<br />
&ldquo;Bind ye Sir Carl before my eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Up then amain the nine warriors rise,<br />
They bound Sir Carl &rsquo;fore their sovereign&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>And out from the town Sir Carl they convey&rsquo;d,<br />
And upon a new wheel his body laid.</p>
<p>To Sir Plog then quickly a messenger came:<br />
&ldquo;The Dane-king has broken thy brother&rsquo;s
frame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Plog he sprang o&rsquo;er the wide, wide board,<br />
But returned in answer no single word.</p>
<p>In his buckskin boots his shanks he cased<br />
And around his gilded spurs he braced.</p>
<p>His gilded spurs there around he tied,<br />
And away to the Ting the noble hied.</p>
<p>And fast and furious was his course,<br />
So leapt and bounded his gallant horse.</p>
<p><!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>Up, up to the Ting Sir Plog he goes,<br />
And up to receive him the Dane-king rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I had been earlier here to-day,<br />
Then things had turned out in a better way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My brother is wheeled though he did no wrong,<br />
That deed, Dane-king, thou shalt rue ere long.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If four hours sooner I had but come,<br />
My brother, for certain, had followed me home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Deprived of his life doth my brother lie,<br />
Dane-king, thou hast lost thine honour thereby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Dane-king so fitting an answer returned:<br />
&ldquo;Thy brother full richly his death had earned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the great with sword can oppress the mean<br />
The law is not worth a rotten bean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My brother, Sir King, was good and bold,<br />
I could have redeemed him with silver and gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thy silver and gold I hold at nought,<br />
The law shall have the course it ought.</p>
<p><!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>&ldquo;And since thou so long on this matter doth
prate,<br />
Thou shalt suffer the very same fate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To warriors nine the Dane-king cries:<br />
&ldquo;Bind ye Sir Plog before my eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If a truly brave man, Dane-king, thou be,<br />
Do thou thyself bind and fetter me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King off his hands the little gloves took,<br />
Sir Plog his spear with vehemence shook.</p>
<p>He first slew four, then five he slew,<br />
And the Dane-king himself with his warriors true.</p>
<p>When all the King&rsquo;s men he dead had laid,<br />
His gallant brother he home convey&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>To Ribe the royal corse they bear,<br />
Where it rests &rsquo;neath a tomb of marble fair.</p>
<p>But Sir Plog he went to a foreign shore,<br />
No word they heard of him evermore.</p>

25</span>THE ELVES</h2>
<p><i>Take heed</i>, <i>good people</i>, <i>of yourselves</i>;<br
/>
<i>And oh</i>! <i>beware ye of the elves</i>.</p>
<p>Once a peasant young and gay<br />
Was in his meadow cutting hay,<br />
There came a lovely looking lass<br />
From out the neighbouring morass.<br />
The lass he woo&rsquo;d, her promise won,<br />
And soon the bridal day came on.<br />
But when the pair had got to bed,<br />
The bridegroom found, with fear and dread,<br />
That he a rough oak stump embrac&rsquo;d,<br />
Instead of woman&rsquo;s lovely waist.<br />
Then, to increase his fear and wonder,<br />
There sang a voice his window under:</p>
<p><!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>&ldquo;Come out to her whom thou didst wed,<br />
Upon my mead the bed is spread.&rdquo;<br />
From that wild lay the peasant knew<br />
He with a fay had had to do.</p>
<p><i>Take heed</i>, <i>good people</i>, <i>of yourselves</i>;<br
/>
<i>And oh</i>! <i>beware ye of the elves</i>.</p>
<h2>FERIDUN</h2>
<p>No face of an Angel could Feridun claim,<br />
Nor of musk nor of amber I ween was his frame;<br />
In bright generosity beauteous was he,<br />
Be generous like him and as fair thou shalt be.</p>

27</span>EPIGRAMS</h2>
<h3>1.</h3>
<p>A worthless thing is song, I trow,<br />
From out the heart which does not flow;<br />
But song from out no heart will flow<br />
Which does not feel of love the glow.</p>
<h3>2.</h3>
<p>Though pedants have essayed to hammer<br />
Into our heads the points of grammar;<br />
We&rsquo;re oft obliged to set at nought<br />
The different force of <i>should</i> and <i>ought</i>;<br />
And oft are sorely puzzled whether<br />
We should make use of <i>both</i> or <i>either</i>.</p>
<h3>3.</h3>
<p>When of yourself you have cause to speak<br />
Always make yourself broad and tall;<br />
Envy attacks you if you are great,<br />
But thorough contempt attends the small.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://www.gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
